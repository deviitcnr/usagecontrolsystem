/**
 * This is the UCSInterface.
 * <p>
 * This interface is meant to be used by <b>external nodes or PEPs</b> wanting
 * to communicate with the UCS that offers it. <br>
 * As said also in the documentation, this interface will offer many methods in
 * order to follow a Do One Thing Well strategy. Functions offered by this
 * interface are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>tryAccess</i> in order to allow an external component to ask for a
 * tryAccess evaluation
 * <li>
 * <li><i>tryAccessResponse</i> in order to receive the response to the
 * tryAccess evaluation requested to an external node</li>
 * <li><i>startAccess</i> in order to allow an external component to ask for a
 * startAccess evaluation
 * <li>
 * <li><i>startAccessResponse</i> in order to receive the response to the
 * startAccess evaluation requested to an external node</li>
 * <li><i>endAccess</i> in order to allow an external component to ask for a
 * endAccess evaluation
 * <li>
 * <li><i>endAccessResponse</i> in order to receive the response to the
 * endAccess evaluation requested to an external node</li>
 * <li><i>onGoingEvaluation</i> in order to allow an external component to ask
 * for an onGoingEvaluation
 * <li>
 * <li><i>onGoingEvaluation</i> in order to receive the response to the
 * onGoingEvaluation requested to an external node</li>
 * <li><i>retrieveRemote</i> in order to retrieve an attribute from a remote
 * node
 * <li>
 * <li><i>retrieveRemoteResponse</i> in order to receive the value of the remote
 * attribute previously requested</li>
 * </ul>

     * Request of a tryAccess evaluation.

     * The tryAccess is the first operation required by a PEP before starting the
     * effective action on a certain resource. It asks (in general) for evaluation
     * of immutable attributes, i.e., attributes that do not change their value very
     * often. In this implementation this function can be called either by a PEP
     * directly connected to this UCS, either by a Node that has scheduled the
     * execution of a tryAccess directed to it to this node.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param tryAccessMessage
     *          the tryAccessMessage object, it contains all the informations
     *          required for the recipient to call back the caller and all the
     *          informations to correctly evaluate the request.

     * performing the action in order to notify the UCS that the action is started
     * and to query the UCS if it still has the permission to perform the action. In
     * general in this case also mutable attributes are taken into account. This
     * operation triggers also the monitoring of the attributes used to evaluate the
     * policy in order to react if something changes. This operation might also be
     * asked from the scheduler of another UCS, exactly as it happens in tryAccess.

     * notify the UCS that its session has finished. There are two reasons for
     * ending a session:
     * <ol>
     * <li>the PEP has performed the operation and does not need the resource
     * anymore</li>
     * <li>one of the mutable attributes present in the policy to be evaluated for
     * the startAccess has changed its value and the PEP does not have the rights to
     * use the resource anymore</li>
     * </ol>
     * In any case when the PEP sends an endAccess is to notify the end of a session
     * and this allows the UCS to free some resources. This operation might also be
     * assked from the scheduler of another UCS, exactly as it happens in tryAccess
     * and startAccess.
